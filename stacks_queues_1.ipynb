    "\n",
    "1)\"Efficient mangement of functions- When a function is called the local variables are stored in a stack, and it is automatically destroyed once returned. A stack is used when a variable is not used outside that function. It allows you to control how memory is allocated and deallocated. Stack automatically cleans up the object.\"\"\n",
    "2)\"stack helps for LIFO method. \"\n",
    "3)\"memory management is efficicient in terms of dynamic memory management\"\n",
    "4)\"reversing becomes easy\"\n",
    "5)\"one of the drawback-If you find yourself needing to index your data structure and get a specific item in the middle of your use case, stacks are not the solution. It would take O of N time in the worst case because you would need to pop off everything on the stack\"]"
